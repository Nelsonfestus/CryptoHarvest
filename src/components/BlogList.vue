            'Asset allocation is the process of dividing your portfolio among different asset classes. A common rule of thumb is to subtract your age from 100 to determine the percentage to invest in stocks.',
            'Regular portfolio rebalancing ensures your asset allocation stays aligned with your goals and risk tolerance. This involves selling some investments and buying others to maintain your target allocation.',
